* Cameron Mackintosh (https://github.com/cbmackintosh)

**Abstract:**

In this project, you will be creating a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them. The idea is similar to sites like All Recipes or New York Times Cooking. Users should be able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook.

**Installation Instructions:**

- Clone this repository `git@github.com:cbmackintosh/whats-cookin.git`
- Install the following dependencies: `npm install` and `npm install @glidejs/glide`
- From the root directory, open the application on web browser using `open ./src/index.html`
